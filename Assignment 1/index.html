          <h2>About Olubunmi</h2>
          <p>
            My name is <b>Olubunmi Alabi</b>, Alt School Id:
            <b>ALT/SOE024/0434.</b> I am a graduate of the university of lagos
            where I studies mechanical engineering. I have spent the last 12
            years in the construction field developing residential buildings.
          </p>
          <p>My hobbies include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Playing football</li>
            <li>Watching football</li>
            <li>Reading books</li>
            <li>Hanging out with my friends</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fun fact, I have no prior knowledge of coding or computer
            engineering and the few times that I have tried to learn I got a bit
            overwhelmed and gave up. Now more than ever I feel a desire to learn
            and not give and this is a major reason for me enrolling in Alt
            School becuase I know I learn better when I have people to guide,
            tutor and support me.

        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos State, on the 28<sup
            >th</sup
          >
          of April, 1987 to the family of Mr. and Mrs Olulola Alabi. I have 2
          Siblings, an elder sister who nis happily married now and a younger
          brother. I attended St. Leo's Catholic Primary School from 1990-1996,
          and after that I attended International School University of Lagos
          from 1996-2002. I then attended the University of Lagos where I
          studied Mechanical Engineering from 2003-2008 where I graduated with a
          B.Sc Second Class Honors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then went on to serve my country in the national youth service
          program (NYSC)where I was posted to Ogun State for the duration of the
          service program. After the program and due to my acquired experiences
          I realized I had a passion for construction as it brought me so much
          joy watching building being erected from the ground up and I decided
          to venture into the construction industry and the residential real
          estate arm to be precise and this has been my practice for the last 12
          years or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am happily married to my beautiful wife, Simisola Alabi and I wish I
          could add her picture just to show off my new HTML skills but I will
          remian humble for now. We have been married for 2 years and hope to be
          belssed with children in the nearest future.

        <h2>Reason for Enrolling in Alt School</h2>
        <p>
          I actually have a couple of reasons for enrolling in Alt School and i
          shall list them below:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I have been fascinated by the tech space and tech industry for a
            while and I have always wanted to understand better how websites,
            mobile applications are built and better understand how the code is
            written that makes a computer know how to interpret the message
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to the nature of my Job, I tend to have spare time that I
            thought I'd put to better use by attending Alt School and studying
            backend engineering
          </li>
          <li>
            An important reason as well is to be able to bring my business ideas
            to fruition and reality with the help of people who I believe can
            make this possible.
          </li>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I have a couple of goals which i have set for my self and i shall list
          a couple below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My major goal in life if I am being honest is to still be one of the
            best real estate developers in the country and I have a personal
            goal that I have set for myself which is to develop an
            architecturally and aesthetically beautiful skycrapper in Lagos
            State simply because it is rhe Centre of Excellence.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the Tech side, one of my goals is to become a very good backend
            engineer so that i can be able to play around different ideas for
            business solutions that I have and see what is feasible and what
            isn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the interim, my goal is to use my knowledge as a backend engineer
            to work parttime and earn some extra cash which I will use to
            support my cost of living
          </li>
